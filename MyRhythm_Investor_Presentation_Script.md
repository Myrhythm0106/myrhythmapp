## **SECTION 1: OPENING & FOUNDER STORY (3-4 minutes)**

### **Opening Hook**
*[Stand confidently, make eye contact with audience]*

"Three years ago, I was told I might never fully recover from my traumatic brain injury. Today, I'm here to show you how that experience led to a £2.3 billion market opportunity that's transforming cognitive wellness for millions."

*[Pause for effect]*

### **Personal Journey**
"My name is [Your Name], and I'm the founder of MyRhythm. In [Year], my life changed forever when I suffered a traumatic brain injury. Like 1.4 million people annually in our target markets, I faced a fragmented healthcare system with no comprehensive solution for cognitive recovery."

*[Show slide with personal photo/timeline]*

"But in that moment of vulnerability, I made a choice—what I call my '#IChoose' moment. I chose to not just recover, but to transform that experience into something that could help millions of others facing similar challenges."

### **The Problem Discovery**
"During my recovery, I discovered that existing solutions were either:
- **Consumer-focused** like Lumosity—fun games but no real clinical integration
- **Clinical-only** like CogniFit—effective but terrible user experience
- **Single-purpose** tools that didn't address the whole person

There was no platform that combined clinical-grade effectiveness with consumer-friendly experience while supporting the entire care ecosystem."

### **The Vision**
"That's when MyRhythm was born—not just as a business opportunity, but as a mission to bridge the gap between consumer cognitive wellness and clinical brain injury recovery, built by someone who's lived the experience."
