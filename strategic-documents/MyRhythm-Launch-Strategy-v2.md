### Price Increase Triggers

## Feature Rollout Strategy

1. **Release features to ALL users** via the What's New page
2. **Communicate value** through in-app notifications
3. **Reduce support burden** with clear documentation
4. **Build loyalty** by continuously adding value

### Feature Release Cadence
- **Monthly:** Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Quarterly:** Major feature releases
- **Annually:** Platform evolution (v1.0, v2.0)

### Communication Strategy
1. In-app "What's New" page (notification badge)
2. Email announcement to subscribers
3. Social media celebration
4. Founder video for major releases
