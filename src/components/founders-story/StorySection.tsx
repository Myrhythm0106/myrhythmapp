        <p>
          Fifteen years ago, I walked into the unknown.<br />
          After 43 days in hospital and more in rehab, I left with no map â€” just fear, fatigue, and faith.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-foreground">
          No one gave me a plan.<br />
          No guide on how to rebuild confidence.<br />
          No tips on how to live when your brain feels like a stranger.
        </p>
        
        <p className="font-medium text-foreground">But God showed up â€” and so did I.</p>
        
        <p className="text-foreground">I began building from scratch:</p>
        
        <p className="text-foreground">
          When I couldn't trust my memory, I created structure.<br />
          When I lost my confidence, I found strength in small wins.<br />
          When I felt invisible, I gave myself visibilityâ€”with routine and reflection.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-foreground">
          That's how MyRhythm was born.<br />
          Not as an app. But as a lifeline.<br />
          Now it's a tool, refined and real â€” built on what actually helped me reclaim my life.

          Today?<br />
          I'm a proud mother of two.<br />
          An EMBA graduate.<br />
          A Change & Project Management leader.<br />
          A global speaker.<br />
          And a woman who dared to find her rhythm and rise.
