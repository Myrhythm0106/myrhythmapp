        <p>Fifteen years ago, a brain aneurysm nearly ended my life.</p>
        <p className="text-foreground">
          Doctors said I will die imminently!<br />
          That I'd never return to work...<br />
          That my memory wouldn't come back. To almost bring tears to my eyes...they said that,<br />
          Motherhood would have to be delayed for at least 5 years...
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium text-foreground">But I refused to live by those limits and the stigma of being incapable of working, learning, contributing meaningfully or being 'broken'.</p>
        <p className="text-foreground">
          Today, I'm a proud mother of two.<br />
          An EMBA graduate.<br />
          An ambitious Change and Project Management leader.<br />
          A global speaker.<br />
          And the founder of MyRhythm, the privilege of sharing my 'how' into this very tool that helped me reclaim my life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground">This is my truth. This app is built on what actually worked when everything seemed impossible.</p>
        <p className="text-foreground">
          When I couldn't rely on memory or focus, I created structure.<br />
          When I lost confidence, I built momentum with small wins.<br />
          When I felt invisible, I gave myself visibilityâ€”with routines and reflection.
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium text-foreground">
          I used MyRhythm to rebuild my identity.<br />
          Now, it's your turn.
