          When short-term memory failed me, I needed more than sticky notes and reminders.<br />
          I needed a system that worked with my brain, not against it.

          <li>Pass my Executive MBA</li>
          <li>Manage complex international projects</li>

          <li>Restore my joy, my focus, and my rhythm</li>
