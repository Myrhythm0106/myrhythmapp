        content: `Hi ${memberName},

We wanted to let you know that ${user?.user_metadata?.name || 'your accountability partner'} hasn't checked in with their MyRhythm routine for a few days.

As someone in their support circle, you might want to:
â€¢ Send them a quick text or call
â€¢ Check if they're doing okay
â€¢ Offer encouragement or practical help
â€¢ Remind them that you're here for them

Sometimes people with brain health challenges need extra support to maintain their routines, and your caring outreach can make all the difference.

Thank you for being part of their support network.

With appreciation,
