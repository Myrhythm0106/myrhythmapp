### Post 1: Founder's Story (Personal)

**Copy:**
```
Three years ago, a brain injury changed everything.

I couldn't remember conversations. Promises slipped away. My relationships suffered.

I tried every reminder app, every note-taking system, every "productivity hack." Nothing worked because they weren't built for brains like mine.

So I built MyRhythm.

🎙️ Record a conversation
🧠 AI extracts your commitments
📅 Reminders that actually work (they escalate until you respond)
💚 A support circle who has your back

Today, we're opening doors to our first 500 Founding Members.

£10/month. Lock in this price forever.

Every promise you keep builds trust. You're building something amazing.

### Post 3: Science-Backed (Educational)

**Copy:**
```
Why do traditional reminders fail people with memory challenges?

They're designed for neurotypical brains.

One notification. Easy to dismiss. No context.

Brain science tells us something different:

🧠 Memory anchors matter — "Why did I set this reminder?" needs to be answered
🧠 Escalation works — Increasing urgency mimics natural importance signals  
🧠 Social accountability helps — Knowing someone cares creates motivation
🧠 Celebration reinforces — Small wins build lasting habits

This is why we built MyRhythm differently.

Our Brain Health Reminders use progressive escalation with contextual memory anchors. By Level 3, your Support Circle is notified.

It's not about nagging. It's about building a system that works WITH your brain.

Founding Member spots available: £10/month forever.

### Thread: Launch Announcement

**Tweet 1:**
```
🧵 I built a reminder app because every other one failed me.

After my brain injury, I couldn't:
- Remember conversations
- Keep track of promises
- Trust my own memory

Standard apps? Useless.

So I built @MyRhythmApp. Here's what's different:
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
🎙️ Memory Bridge

Record any conversation. AI extracts action items automatically.

"Call Dr. Smith tomorrow at 2pm" → Calendar event created
"I'll send you the photos" → Reminder set
"Don't forget milk" → Added to your list

No typing. No forgetting.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
🧠 Brain Health Reminders

Not just one notification you dismiss.

Level 1: Gentle nudge
Level 2: More urgent reminder
Level 3: Support Circle notified

Reminders that escalate until you respond.

Because your brain needs more than one ping.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
💪 Daily Brain Boost

240+ challenges across:
- Cognitive exercises
- Emotional wellness
- Social connection
- Physical health

Each one explains "Why this helps your brain."

Build streaks. Build habits. Build a healthier brain.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
💚 Support Circle

Invite 5 trusted people as your safety net.

They can:
- See your calendar
- Get notified if reminders escalate
- Send encouragement

You're not alone in this.
```

```
To everyone in this community who understands what it's like to lose trust in your own memory...

I built something for us.

MyRhythm isn't another productivity app. It's a brain health tool designed by someone who GETS IT.

After my TBI, I lost so much:
- Conversations disappeared
- Promises were forgotten  
- Relationships strained

I tried everything. Nothing worked.

So I built what I needed:

🎙️ Memory Bridge - Record conversations, AI extracts your commitments
🧠 Progressive Reminders - They escalate until you respond
💚 Support Circle - Trusted people who have your back

We're launching to our first 500 Founding Members.

£10/month. Forever. (Regular price will be £15)

7-day free trial. Full access.

For everyone who's ever said "I forgot" and felt that shame... this is for you.

Every promise you keep builds trust. You're building something amazing. 💪
