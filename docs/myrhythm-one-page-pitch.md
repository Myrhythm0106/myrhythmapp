## Transform Conversations into Kept Promises

---

### THE PROBLEM

**69 million people** experience traumatic brain injury globally each year. **53 million caregivers** in the US alone support loved ones with memory challenges. Existing reminder apps fail them because they're designed for neurotypical brains.

**The gap:** One notification, easily dismissed, no context = forgotten promises, strained relationships, eroded trust.

---

### OUR SOLUTION

MyRhythm is the **first reminder app built on brain science**.

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| 🎙️ **Memory Bridge** | Record conversations → AI extracts action items |
| 🧠 **Brain Health Reminders** | Progressive escalation (gentle → moderate → urgent) |
| 💪 **Daily Brain Boost** | 240+ science-backed cognitive challenges |
| 💚 **Support Circle** | Trusted people notified when you need help |

---

### UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION

> **"The only reminder app that escalates until you respond — with your support network as backup."**

Unlike generic productivity tools, MyRhythm:
- Uses **contextual memory anchors** ("Here's why this matters...")
- Implements **progressive escalation** mimicking natural importance signals
- Activates **social accountability** without shame
- Builds **habits through celebration** and streak tracking
